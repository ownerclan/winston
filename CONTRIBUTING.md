## What makes up `winston@3.0.0`?

As of `winston@3.0.0` the project has been broken out into a few modules:

- [winston-transport]: `Transport` stream implementation & legacy `Transport` wrapper.
- [logform]: All formats exports through `winston.format` 
- `LEVEL` and `MESSAGE` symbols exposed through [triple-beam].
- [Shared test suite][abstract-winston-transport] for community transports 

Let's dig in deeper. The example below has been annotated to demonstrate the different packages that compose the example itself:

``` js
const { createLogger, transports, format } = require('winston');
const Transport = require('winston-transport');
const logform = require('logform');
const { combine, timestamp, label, printf } = logform.format;

// winston.format is require('logform')
console.log(logform.format === format) // true

const logger = createLogger({
  format: combine(
    label({ label: 'right meow!' }),
    timestamp(),
    printf(nfo => {
      return `${nfo.timestamp} [${nfo.label}] ${nfo.level}: ${nfo.message}`;
    })
  ),
  transports: [new transports.Console()]
});
```

## What about `winston@2.x`?!

> _If you are opening an issue regarding the `2.x` release-line please know that 2.x work has ceased. The `winston` team will review PRs that fix issues, but as issues are opened we will close them._

You will commonly see this closing `winston@2.x` issues:

```
Development `winston@2.x` has ceased. Please consider upgrading to `winston@3.0.0-rc3`. If you feel strongly about this bug please open a PR against the `2.x` branch. Thank you for using `winston`!
```

## Could this be implemented as a format?

Before opening issues for new features consider if this feature could be implemented as a [custom format]. If it is, you will see your issue closed with this message:

```
In `winston@3.0.0` you can <IMPLEMENT FEATURE> using [custom formats](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#creating-custom-formats). Please consider upgrading.
```

## Roadmap

Below is the list of items that make up the roadmap through `3.1.0`. We are actively triaging the open issues, so it is likely a few more critical path items will be added to this list before `3.0.0` gets out of RC.

- [Bugs](#bugs)
- [Documentation](#documentation)
- [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)

### Bugs

#### Show stoppers before `3.0.0`

- [ ] https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/issues/1144: this is _the_ purpose of `winston`. If we cannot log at high-volume we cannot ship out of RC. There was [test coverage for this][stress-test] that should be failing, but isnt
- [ ] Triage all open issues.

### Documentation

- [ ] Finish `3.0.0` upgrade guide: https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/blob/master/UPGRADE-3.0.md
- [ ] Update `docs/transports.md`.
